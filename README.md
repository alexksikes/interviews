### Classic Tech Interviews in Python

I would give myself about ~30 min (or less, sometimes more) for each question.
Most interview questions are from the excellent [cracking the coding
interview][0] book. I chose Python as a programming language as it writes
almost like pseudo code.

It was a good review overall and a pretty fun exercise to get things well in
place :)

The extra directory holds some questions not found in the book but asked
during an actual interview.

Note: it is very likely that some answers do have bugs. The idea was to
write the most optimal solution but in the shortest amount of time possible!
